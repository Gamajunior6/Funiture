# Funiture
Good day, today 1st August 2022, i started a new landing page project at exactly 4:21 pm.


Good day, excitedly the landing page project is concluded. It took me 3wks with 2wks constant focus and consistency. 
Due to unforeseen circumstances  the project took longer than it should, as my environment is not light friendly and also my computer is not fast enough, more like i need an upgrade(with time i will buy).I have learn a lot, i searched through google for answers, i asked friend for help, i also ask strangers for help during the project, which i so much appreciated.

I made the project with only HTML and CSS, for desktop.
